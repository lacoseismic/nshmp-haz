# Using nshmp-haz with Python

There are a few different packages that will allow you to call Java code from Python.
This example uses jpype.  It also uses NumPy to simplify working with the arrays
returned by the ground motion model calculators.

## Requirements

1. A [build](https://github.com/usgs/nshmp-haz/wiki/building-&-running) of nshmp-haz.
2. [jpype](http://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
3. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
