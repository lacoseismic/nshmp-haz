# Examples

These examples are designed to be executed locally while following the READMEs on GitHub.
All examples avoid a lengthy call to Java and the `HazardCalc` program by using the following
system alias:

```Shell
alias hazard='java -cp /path/to/nshmp-haz/build/libs/nshmp-haz.jar gov.usgs.earthquake.nshmp.HazardCalc'
```

Because each example builds on prior concepts, it is best step through all the examples, however quickly.
