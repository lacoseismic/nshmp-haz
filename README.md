# nshmp-haz

U.S. Geological Survey ([USGS][1]) National Seismic Hazard Model Project ([NSHMP][2]) codes for
performing probabilistic seismic hazard (PSHA) and related analyses. These codes are intended for
use with seismic hazard models developed by the NSHMP for the U.S. and its territories. This
project includes a variety of command line applications and web service classes and relies on the
[*nshmp-lib*][3] hazard library, among other dependencies.

Please see the [documentation](docs/README.md) for more information.
