# nshmp-haz

U.S. Geological Survey ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov)) National Seismic Hazard Model Project
([NSHMP](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/)) codes for performing probabilistic seismic
hazard (PSHA) and related analyses. These codes are intended for use with seismic hazard models
developed by the NSHMP for the U.S. and its territories. This project includes a variety of
command line applications and web service classes and relies on the
[*nshmp-lib*](https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/nshmp/nshmp-lib) hazard library, among other
dependencies.

Please see the [docs](https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/nshmp/nshmp-haz-v2/-/tree/master/docs) for more information.
